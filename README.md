# Math-Concepts-for-Developers


This was my final project for the Math Concepts for Developers course at SoftUni. The first part investigates the Monty Hall problem and uses probability as well as simulations done with python to prove it. The second part is concerned with basic cases of Monte Carlo simulations for solving integrals.
