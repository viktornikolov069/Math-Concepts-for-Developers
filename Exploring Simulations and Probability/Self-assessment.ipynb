    "* Use Jupyter notebook for text and maths. You can use any programming language you would like.\n",
    "* Write your research and code in English. Bulgarian is also acceptable but try to use English.\n",
    "* If you have sensitive, copyrighted, or copy-protected assets, including but not limited to, images, multimedia, code, documents, and datasets,\n",
    "  you can sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) with the SoftUni team. Contact the lecturer if you need assistance with the process.\n",
    "* Any code which does not comply with the Bulgarian law (as of the exam date), will be given zero points.\n",
    "* Any malicious code, or code intended to do harm to the user's computer, information, or privacy, will be given zero points.\n",

    "\t* Is the code thoroughly tested?\n",
    "\t* Are there any comparisons to other implementations / other articles / previous research?\n",
    "7. Visualization (8)\n",
    "\t* All kinds of projects employ some visualization: graphical plots, tables, etc.\n",
    "\t* Are all visualizations correct (i.e. convey the intended meaning without misleading the intended audience)?\n",
    "\t* Are all visualizations clear, and easy to understand?\n",
    "8. Communication (10)\n",
